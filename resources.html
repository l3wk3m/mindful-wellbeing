                  <h3>Book Title</h3>
                  <p>This is some placeholder text for the book. I think I would like to add information here with a scrollwheel over this box for the text overflow. I've added the overflow feature now so let's add a good bit of superfluous text to make sure it works. Superfluous is a wonderful word. Wish I got to use that one more often.</p>
                <p>It actually doesn't seem to be working. It seems that with the grid setup, the more text I add, the bigger the box gets. I actually don't hate this as a solution as I think it will look quite nice on the desktop version of the site.</p>
                <p>I think for the tablet version of the site, I would like it to behave like the desktop version, but with the image fully couched in that bg div, and maybe there'd be some slight overlap of the book image and the text, with the book appearing slightly behind the text.</p>
                <p>Then for the fully mobile version of the site I think we fully center the text and image, have the text sitting fully within the the bg div, with the image also sitting within it, but poking it's head out the top of the bg div for a nice overlapping display</p>
                <p>And wahey! In my mountains of text planning this feature I've managed to lock the grid layout at it's maximum height, activating the scroll overflow. It's now working exactly as intended for desktop. Time to commit!</p></div>

                    <h3>Non-Violent Communication</h3>
                    <p>In the Non-Violent Communication audiobook, Marshal Rosenberg himself talks you through the practise he has developed over the course of 4 one hour long sessions.</p>
                    <p>Covering around 2 to 3 topics each session, Marshal helps coach the listener towards a form of communication he has developed in order “to create the quality of connection necessary for everyone’s needs to be met compassionately.”</p>       
                    <p>Although I think he errs a little too heavily on the side of establishing a concrete cognitive framework for communicating, Rosenberg does often come across a little robotic in the way he implements his own practise.</p>

                    <h3>Hold Me Tight</h3>
                    <p>In Hold Me Tight, Sue Johnson synthesizes her own couples focused practise, EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy), into a newbie friendly text full of a variety of examples of the practise in action. Across seven steps, she takes the reader on a journey through her practise.</p>
                    <p>Hold Me Tight is a beautiful and radically compassionate book, aimed at helping couples to navigate the seas of a romantic relationship in a way that helps us to clearly see and navigate each others’ sore spots and entreat one another in loving compassion. That being said, it is not the easiest book to tackle on this list. Through Hold Me Tight, Sue turns a mirror towards the reader in a way that can at times feel a little uncomfortable. This is an incredible book and I would highly recommend everyone consider adding it to their arsenal, but please exercise some patience and self compassion as you work through it. It is not an easy read - particularly not the first two chapters. Take your time with it and take lots of breaks throughout.</p>
